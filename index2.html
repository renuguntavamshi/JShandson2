    <!-- Find Relation
PrepBuddy wants you to get familiar with various Relational operators. He provides you with two integer values 
X and Y and asks you to find the relation between them.
The relationships between integers X and Y are as follows:
If X<Y, it means that X is smaller than Y.
If X>Y, it means that X is greater than Y.
If X=Y, it means that X is equal to Y. 
Note: You have to complete findRelationship function. No need to take any input. -->
